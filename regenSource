Well, I wouldn't call it "math", rather "simple extrapolation", which, to be fair, is based on math.
Per level
4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000. So you get per tick: 13.3, 16.6, 20, 23.3,26.66
So you need work: 7, 9, 10, 12, 14
I like to even it up and round up: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
Note: It adds the effect every 15 ticks while the source has energy in it. So you're better off having 100.0% miner coverage and the minimum number of work parts.

Actually, I'm wrong. It keeps inserting the effect every 15 ticks even if the source is empty... so you're better off with a slightly aggressive miner. The 8 to 16 path is the way to go.
That way if it's delayed getting on station, or throws a few link transfers or whatever... you still scrape out every last drop.
It's really no ops.
Which is a head scratcher in that it's a high level power... You literally HAVE to have gotten the ops one to even use it.
